# Wave Propagation aided by Deep Learning (Code)

This repository contains the Python code of my master's thesis about wave propagation algorithms
that are combined with machine learning components to reduce the computation time while being
sufficiently accurate. The Latex writeup will be published soon.

Under [`notebooks_workflow`](https://github.com/utkaiser/masterthesis_code/tree/main/notebook_workflow),
we provided simple notebooks that introduce the key topics such as:<br>
- use of numerical algorithms (velocity Verlet and pseudo-spectral method)
- generate data (initial condition and wave profile)
- train end-to-end model (further discussed in writeup)
- Parareal scheme.
